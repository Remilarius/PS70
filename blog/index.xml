      <description>Demo Video   Motivation I really wanted something that moved around my house because I&amp;rsquo;ve been stuck inside for way to long. I wanted something autonomous to keep me company and since my mom wasn&amp;rsquo;t on board with having a dog, I decided to build one.
Fabrication Since parts that needed to be lasercut or 3D printed needed to be designed and made first, decisions regarding how to spatially fit everything had to be made early on and all other parts had to conform.</description>

      <description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find many small interesting objects around the house so I settled for tossing my d20 into the silicone.
It didn&amp;rsquo;t require too much liquid since it was so small and I was on the cautious side. I also found the narrowest cup in the house to do this with.
A little afraid to cut it out for now, I think it needs to harden a little more.
I want to make ice dodecahderons with the mold, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;d survive a session of DND but it might be fun if the numbers show up on the die.</description>

      <description>BLE I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try the BLE subset of the assignment since my team had been thinking about ways to control a drone and BLE was one of the options we were considering.
I followed the instructions on the class website and uploaded the BLE_write program from examples
For the LED specifically, there was this code also on the class website. /* Based on Neil Kolban example for IDF: https://github.com/nkolban/esp32-snippets/blob/master/cpp_utils/tests/BLE%20Tests/SampleWrite.cpp Ported to Arduino ESP32 by Evandro Copercini */ #include &amp;lt;BLEDevice.</description>

      <description>The whole process of getting the ESP32 Cam working started out with a hiccup. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find board that connected the ESP32CAM to my computer for the longest time because it turned out that I had a different board form everyone else. It didn&amp;rsquo;t make much of a difference because nothing worked after I hooked it up. I tried to upload the Blink code to the board as a test but I got an LED_BUILTIN error.</description>

      <description>Still messing the microphone and TFT display, but in the meantime I had seperately accomplish this goal with other equipment actually.
The BNO085 is an IMU that can be connected to an Arduino, like MKRZero or Wifi 1010, and it&amp;rsquo;s an accelerometer like the one in our kit. It can read the XYZ or roll, pitch, yaw of the board to determine the orientation and outputs the information to a serial monitor.</description>

      <description>Photogrammetry I thought it might be good to have a 3D model of the Tile Sticker so that I could have a complete assembly later down the line. I used the Qlone app, probably more hopeful than I should been about the result, and struggled to scan the Tile Sticker for about 15 minutes. The final result:
It came out really deformed on the top and sides, unusable.
3D Print Bike Tile Holder I didn&amp;rsquo;t what I had to secure the two halves with so I dug through the shed toolbox for screws or fasteners.</description>

      <description>Piezobuzzer Circuit I wanted to play some music with a piezo buzzer since I was given the basics in ES50, so I decided to map over knowledge from the class and use the materials from PS70 to make something more extensive.
I used the HUZZAH Feather board instead of the Metro Express or Arduino MKRZero and that required downloading the associated libaries and packets.
TinkerCad Mockup w/Single pin I built a quick circuit in TinkerCad to make sure the LED and Piezobuzzer would work as expected, the only modfication I would have to make to this would be to seperate the pin inputs for the LED and Piezo buzzer since they&amp;rsquo;re controlled differently in the Buzzer code libraries.</description>

      <description>Fishing reel I decided to make an automatic fishing reel, scaled down.
Circuit This is the circuit built in TinkerCAD   Layout I used the potentiometer to control the speed of the reel, ended up being quite a challenge since I only had two hands.</description>

      <description>Part 1: Circuits I constructed a simple circuit in TinkerCad to see what it&amp;rsquo;s like before building it in real life with the parts in the kit.
Part 2: Press-Fit Kit Since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t constrained by having to make a core mechanism with 2D design this time around, I decided to make a sliced model of a boat with a center mast and two back masts.
Trimaran I did not concern myself with tolerancing and did all the parameters in inches.</description>

      <description>Documentation and website setup.
Process I was lured into using a static site generator instead of the usual HTML and CSS because it woulld require less coding.
We were given a choice between Hugo or Jekyll and Andrew and I chose the same theme in Hugo, Osprey Delight, to share the burden of learning to manipulate and Sean helped us set it up.
We didn&amp;rsquo;t read the READme and that&amp;rsquo;s where the problems started.</description>
