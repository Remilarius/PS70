      <description>The whole process of getting the ESP32 Cam working started out with a hiccup. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find board that connected the ESP32CAM to my computer for the longest time because it turned out that I had a different board form everyone else. It didn&amp;rsquo;t make much of a difference because nothing worked after I hooked it up. I tried to upload the Blink code to the board as a test but I got an LED_BUILTIN error.</description>

      <description>Photogrammetry I thought it might be good to have a 3D model of the Tile Sticker so that I could have a complete assembly later down the line. I used the Qlone app, probably more hopeful than I should been about the result, and struggled to scan the Tile Sticker for about 15 minutes. The final result:
It came out really deformed on the top and sides, unusable.
3D Print Bike Tile Holder I didn&amp;rsquo;t what I had to secure the two halves with so I dug through the shed toolbox for screws or fasteners.</description>

      <description>Part 1: Circuits I constructed a simple circuit in TinkerCad to see what it&amp;rsquo;s like before building it in real life with the parts in the kit.
Part 2: Press-Fit Kit Since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t constrained by having to make a core mechanism with 2D design this time around, I decided to make a sliced model of a boat with a center mast and two back masts.
Trimaran I did not concern myself with tolerancing and did all the parameters in inches.</description>

      <description>Documentation and website setup.
Process I was lured into using a static site generator instead of the usual HTML and CSS because it woulld require less coding.
We were given a choice between Hugo or Jekyll and Andrew and I chose the same theme in Hugo, Osprey Delight, to share the burden of learning to manipulate and Sean helped us set it up.
We didn&amp;rsquo;t read the READme and that&amp;rsquo;s where the problems started.</description>
