<!--## And [here's my repo!](https://github.com/kdevo/osprey-delight)-->

<!--Osprey **De**light is a sugar-free version of the [awesome Osprey theme](https://github.com/tomanistor/osprey) by [Toma Nistor](https://tomanistor.com/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).-->

<!--It tastes a bit different than the original (hence the "light" in the name) but also adds some new functionality -- hopefully to your **delight**.-->
