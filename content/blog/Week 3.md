![Analog Read Voltage](analogreadvoltage.)

Create a kinetic sculpture. Include circuitry to move your sculpture.
Control the sculpture with a circuit on a breadboard that uses components in the kit (e.g., resistors, potentiometer). Use a multimeter to measure the voltages in your circuit. Use Ohm's law to calculate current through the circuit.
Use the Microcontroller Analog in (ADC) to measure the voltage of a potentiometer, or other voltage-divider-based sensor.
(Optional) Use tools like TinkerCAD to simulate your circuit and/or tools like Fusion 360 to design and simulate your mechanism.
Document your work and learning. Include at least one video/gif of your sculpture.
