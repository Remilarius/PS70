## Part 1: Circuits

I constructed a simple circuit in TinkerCad to see what it's like before building it in real life with the 	parts in the kit.

## Part 2: Press-Fit Kit

Since I wasn't constrained by having to make a core mechanism with 2D design this time around, I decided to make a sliced model of a boat with a center mast and two back masts.

### Trimaran

I did not concern myself with tolerancing and did all the parameters in inches. I was given the thickness of the material, cardboard, to be 4.3mm (0.169in). Most necessary corners were filleted to prevent stress buildup.

### Parts

* 6x Body Planks
* 4x Ship Body
* 2x Ship Hull
* 2x Center Mast
* 2x Back Mast
* 3x Center Mast Clips
* 2x Side Mast Clips

I worked with Haeyun and Kathryn and they added decoratives to the ship like people, barrels, and cannons.

Haeyun was able to pick up the lasercut pieces and assemble the boat without too much trouble. (02/08/2021)
