Documentation and website setup. 

## Process

I was lured into using a static site generator instead of the usual HTML and CSS because it woulld require less coding. Andrew and I chose the same theme to share the burden of learning to manipulate and Sean helped us set it up.

We didn't read the READme and that's where the problems started.


### Problems that were resolved


### Things I'm still trying to figure how to do with Hugo

#### Images

-Resize images so they don't take up the entire screen.
-Maybe add a photo gallery
