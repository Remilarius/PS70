I couldn't find many small interesting objects around the house so I settled for tossing my d20 into the silicone.

It didn't require too much liquid since it was so small and I was on the cautious side. I also found the narrowest cup in the house to do this with.

A little afraid to cut it out for now, I think it needs to harden a little more.

I want to make ice dodecahderons with the mold, I don't think it'd survive a session of DND but it might be fun if the numbers show up on the die.

### Update:

Second mold: I used a silver dollar. I wanted to see if I could do it as a single part mold and was somewhat successful. Haven't tested it out with chocolate yet.

I did freeze water inside the dice mold but the ice expanded outwards from the top and the numbers were hard to distinguish. Melted fairly quickly. Chocolate or other materials that are solid at a higher temperature would make for a better outcome.

Both molds cam out suprisingly detailed though.
