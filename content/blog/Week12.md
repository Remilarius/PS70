I couldn't find many small interesting objects around the house so I settled for tossing my d20 into the silicone.

It didn't require too much liquid since it was so small and I was on the cautious side. I also found the narrowest cup in the house to do this with.

A little afraid to cut it out for now, I think it needs to harden a little more.

I want to make ice dodecahderons with the mold, I don't think it'd survive a session of DND but it might be fun if the numbers show up on the die.

Keeping my eye out for something else to cast.
