## Photogrammetry

I thought it might be good to have a 3D model of the Tile Sticker so that I could have a complete assembly later down the line. I used the Qlone app, probably more hopeful than I should been about the result, and struggled to scan the Tile Sticker for about 15 minutes. The final result:

It came out really deformed on the top and sides, unusable.

## 3D Print Bike Tile Holder

I didn't what I had to secure the two halves with so I dug through the shed toolbox for screws or fasteners. It happens that I had these four nut and bolts so I had to measure dimensions to customize the two halves of the holder to perfectly fit.

I tried to cut down the profile of the holder to prevent the edges from sticking out and to save material but did not think to remove a pair of screws to cut down the height by almost half. Print time for both the front and back came close to 20 hours with 15% infill.

### Cutting print time

I figured the 4 hole version of the tile holder did cost too much unnecessary material so I decided to change the parameters to about half the height and getting rid of a row of holes.
