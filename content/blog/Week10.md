I spent most of this week on getting the 3D materials and lasercut parts in.

I had built my dimensions off the leg of the wolf, the immutable element being the N20 motor with the wheel mounted on. Since I wanted them to be contained, this made the minimum width of the leg 2 inches.

I tried to make the build somewhat modular, with a repeating set of fasteners. This kinda of exploded the build a little bit since fasteners were needed at every joint and intersection. Avoid this in the future.

Each body piece 

All parts were made in Solidworks and extruded to appropriate thickness. Pieces were assembled to make sure everything fit properly.

The DXF files were generated in AutoCAD.

### Notes

Errors made:

With AutoCAD, the dimensions need to be scaled properly since units are absolute, everything should be in metric. Either centimeters or millimeters.

Make sure there's no doubling on the lines. May be due to exporting wrong view in Solidworks.
